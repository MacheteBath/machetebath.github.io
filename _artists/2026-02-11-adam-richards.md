Raised between the mountains and the sea in North Wales, I found music early. The first album I bought was The Prodigy – Experience (1992). I was 11, and the repetition - the pulse of it - stuck.

From there it was happy hardcore, trance, house, US house, progressive house and techno. Stripped-back, driving, built for movement rather than noise.

Alongside that sat classical, Motown, soul, jazz and funk - structure, musicianship, groove. An eclectic mix, but it makes sense to me.

What I listen to inevitably shapes what I make. -Adam Richards.
