Saša Delimar a.k.a. Infinity

A DJ with over 20 years of experience, Saša Delimar has been steadily carving out his path as a producer since 2017. Initially known for his releases in the deep techno circuit, he has recently pivoted toward more experimental spheres. To date, his work has been featured on respected labels such as Qeone, IO, Illegal Alien Records, Lowless, Lett, Pyramid Blood, and Oslated.

Saša’s production philosophy centers on finding the perfect equilibrium between home listening and the dancefloor. He equally embraces textural experimentation and the rhythmic intensity required for the club. Since relocating to Berlin, he has performed at renowned venues including Suicide Circus, Griessmühle, Fiese Remise, and //:about blank, and currently holds a residency with Art Bei Ton.
