"FENRA is the electronic project of Portland-based producer B Laws. A mix of atmospheric electronica, forward-thinking production, and genre-blurring sound"

“DEEPCUT opens with a skewed synth melody over strings and atmospheric textures, building tension slowly before revealing its full shape. It’s one of the most energetic tracks on the EP, but I wanted it to take its time — the bassline doesn’t arrive until almost three minutes in, when the track finally locks into place.”
