4Unison started at the age of 18, mixing vinyl records at parties and small nightclubs in his city.
Formed in the culture of analogue format and the dance floor, he understands music as a refuge, resistance and connection with people.
Influenced by dark sounds, echo and reverb effects characteristic of Dub techno and Deep underground.
After many years, he returned out of pure passion to do what he loves, without posturing, just sound pressure.
