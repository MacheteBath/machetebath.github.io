Oiseaux Fantôme composes uplifting, acid-tinged ballads with electronica, techno, and trance influences. Between soundscapes of multicolored textures and electrified kicks, he develops a psychedelic and eclectic techno. Hugo Livet (his real name) is also a visual artist. In his practice, he explores the links between art, nature, and technology through a multidisciplinary and modular approach that he extends to music production.
